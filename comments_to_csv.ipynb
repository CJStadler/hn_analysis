You use the (excellent) Erlang tooling to connect to it, and interrogate it&#x2F;trace it&#x2F;profile it&#x2F;observe it&#x2F;etc. The Erlang runtime <i>is</i> an OS, in every sense of the word; running Erlang on Linux is truly just <i>redundant</i>, since you&#x27;ve already got all the OS you need.

When you&#x27;re in that sort of situation, you <i>need</i> the sort of things an OS provides. And that&#x27;s actually rather rare.<p>The true &quot;good fit&quot; use-case of Unikernels is in immutable infrastructure. You <i>don&#x27;t</i> debug a unikernel, mostly; you just kill and replace it (you &quot;let it crash&quot;, in Erlang terms.) Unikernels are a formalization of the (already prevalent) use-case where you launch some ephemeral VMs or containers as a static, mostly-internally-stateless &quot;release slug&quot; of your application tier, and then roll out an upgrade by starting up new &quot;slugs&quot; and terminating old ones. You can&#x27;t really &quot;debug&quot; those (except via instrumentation compiled into your app, ala NewRelic.) They&#x27;re black boxes. A unikernel just statically links the whole black box together.<p>Keep in mind, &quot;debugging&quot; is two things: development-time debugging and production-time debugging. It&#x27;s only the latter that unikernels are fundamentally bad at. For dev-time debugging, both MirageOS and Erlang-on-Xen come with ways to compile your app as an OS process rather than as a VM image. When you are trying to <i>integration-test</i> your app, you integration-test the process version of it. When you&#x27;re trying to <i>smoke-test</i> your app, you can still use the process version—or you can launch (an instrumented copy of) the VM image.

From that, a difference in the degree of resource pooling follows. A hypervisor offers very low-level abstractions: one or more virtual CPUs, a fixed amount of RAM, one or more virtual block devices, and one or more virtual network interfaces. An operating system, by contrast, typically offers much higher-level abstractions: one or more processes (each of which may have multiple threads), a pool of memory from which the processes can dynamically allocate what they need, a filesystem, and a network protocol stack. These higher-level abstractions are quite mature, so one argument against unikernels is that it is grossly inefficient for each application to bring its own impoverished versions of them.
